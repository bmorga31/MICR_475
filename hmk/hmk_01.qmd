# Hmk 01: A Quarto Document on Github

Is this supposed to take 6 hours?

## Running Code

```{r}
2 * 2
```

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
